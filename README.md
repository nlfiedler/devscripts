## Developer Scripts

My personal collection of utility scripts, mostly useful for software development, which I have
developed over the years. There are many old scripts that were removed simply to reduce the
clutter. Most of the scripts are written in a variant of Lisp called [Hy](http://hylang.org/) which
compiles to Python byte code.
